# 🤖 Groq LLM Chatbot using Streamlit

A simple interactive chatbot built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Groq LLMs** (e.g., LLaMA3). It uses **python-dotenv** to securely load your API key and streams real-time responses using Groq’s SDK.

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit python-dotenv groq
````

---

## 🔐 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your Groq API key:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

---

## 🚀 Run the App

Use the command below to launch the chatbot in your browser:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual filename, e.g., `app.py`.

## 🧠 Features

* ✅ Uses Groq's LLaMA3 (or any supported model)
* ✅ Secure API key handling with `python-dotenv`
* ✅ Real-time message streaming via `stream=True`
* ✅ Session-based chat history with Streamlit UI
* ✅ Minimal, clean, and extendable architecture
